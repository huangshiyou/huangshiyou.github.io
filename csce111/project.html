<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Students will complete a course project in teams of 5-6.
Grading will be shared among all members
(i.e., the project gets a grade, not each student separately),
and we will require specific proof of each member’s role in the group.
Each group must have an external customer (e.g., student organization, local non-profit) to build a SaaS application.
See examples of <a href="http://projects.saas-class.org/projects">previous projects</a> from UC Berkeley.
Be sure to checkout <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FnllGoYuUjhdF1xF1kQRIrWrv_znxqokSq84-uNw8wY/edit#gid=0">the links to project info</a> (customer interview, code repo, Pivotal Tracker, deployed app, screencast demo).

<div id="team-formation" class="section level1">
<h1>Team Formation</h1>
<p>Teams are self-selected. They are normally six members, but class enrollment may require some teams of five.
If you cannot find a team, post on the class forum and the TAs will help you.
If you are not on a team of 5 or 6 members, please post on the class forum looking for a team.
If necessary we will reshuffle teams to make sure all teams have 5 or 6 members.</p>
<p>Please create a team name (<strong>be creative</strong>!). Team names should not include the word "Team".
<strong>ONE PERSON</strong> on the team should send an email to the TAs using the following format:</p>
 <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:105%'><span
  style='font-family:"Courier New";color:black'>To: &lt;TA Name&gt;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</div>


          <div id="project-solicitation" class="section level1">
<h1>Project Proposal (Points: 5)</h1>
<p>Each team is expected to propose its own project idea and a customer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Check the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> to make sure it meets our criteria (on which we must be firm, to keep the course running smoothly).</li>
<li>Make sure everyone on the team agrees to this project.</li>
<li>Email the instructor with the team name, customer name, email, and phone, and a summary of the proposed project.</li> 
    <li>The instructor will email your project customer contact informing them of the project selection (or non-selection)
and which team will contact them.</li>
</ul>
 <p> The instructor may assign a team a different project depending on the availability of projects and experiences of the team.
 <p> Each team will give a five-minute project proposal presentation in class.
</div>

<div id="iteration-zero" class="section level1">
<h1>Iteration 0 (Points: 10)</h1>
<p>This week you should set up meetings with your customer.
Emphasize to them that time is short, so you need to get going right away.
In the first meeting(s) you should extract their user stories,
sketch low-fi user interfaces and story boards (bring something to sketch on/with), etc.
It might help to record your conversation (e.g. on your phone).
You can then iterate with them and prioritize the stories.
Each team should select a <strong>Scrum Master</strong> and <strong>Product Owner</strong>.
The Scrum Master will submit the team reports.
I recommend it be the Product Owner who makes contact with the customer to set up the meetings.
You need to meet with the customer every iteration, if at all possible.</p>
<p><strong>Submit</strong> the following (only one copy for each team), with all elements in a single <strong>pdf</strong> file:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Team members and roles</strong>: The team should elect a scrum master and product owner.</li>
<li>
    <strong>Customer contact and meeting date/time/place</strong>: The team product owner should contact the customer and set up a meeting.</li>
<li>
    <strong>Summary</strong>: Write a two-paragraph (max) summary of the main customer need and how the application meets it, including who the stakeholders are. Include links to the video, GitHub repo and Pivotal Tracker in the document.
</li>
<li><strong>User stories</strong>: Create at least 4 user stories on 3x5 cards. You can submit photos of the 3x5 cards or type them up. Example:
 <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:105%'><span
  style='font-family:"Courier New";color:black'>Feature: Add a movie to Rotten Potatoes<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:105%'><span
  style='font-family:"Courier New";color:black'>As a movie fan<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:105%'><span
  style='font-family:"Courier New";color:black'>So that I can share a movie with other movie fans<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:105%'><span
  style='font-family:"Courier New";color:black'>I want to add a movie to the Rotten Potatoes database<o:p></o:p></span></p>
</li>
<li><strong>User interface</strong>: Create lo-fi UI mockups and storyboards for at least 4 user stories. Submit photos of these.
</li>
<li><strong>Pivotal Tracker</strong>: Create a free open-source public Pivotal Tracker project and enter the user stories. Give access as “observers” to the instructor and TAs.
</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: Produce a 2-minute video interview where customer describes the problem you will be solving and the application you will be building.
<ul>
    <li>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eLqJs_gPkQ"> an example interview</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: you may directly embed the video in the submitted pdf file, or upload the video to vimeo or youtube and include the link in the pdf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Repo</strong>: Populate the initial GitHub repo (private under TAMU or public upon agreement with your client) for your project. Give the instructor and TAs access as collaborators.
</li>
<li><strong>For legacy projects</strong>: write a one-page document discussing your overall strategy for learning/improving the prior code. Also, if any of your user stories are improved/replacement stories for what was done in the past, please note that in this document.
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div id="iterations" class="section level1">
<h1>Iterations 1 to 4 (Points: 5 per iteration)</h1>
<h3>Overall Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Using Pivotal Tracker, identify a subset of stories you'll work on during this iteration and who owns each.
</li>
    <li>Use BDD+TDD to develop these stories and <strong>deploy to Heroku</strong>.
</li>
    <li>For legacy projects, understand and refactor legacy code as necessary.
</li>
    <li>Get feedback from customer and indicate how this will affect the next iteration.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specific Milestones in Each Iteration</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pick approximately ¼ of the stories you submitted for Iteration 0 (along with any later user story additions) for each iteration,
    balancing the workload between each of the iterations. The selection should be based on customer meetings.
</li>
<li>Create a comprehensive set of Cucumber and RSpec test cases for each user story to be implemented.
You should have a Cucumber feature file with one or more scenarios with high-level declarative steps, corresponding to the UI sketches. The test cases must be able to run automatically. Test cases should include both successful and exceptional scenarios (happy and sad paths). Make sure that we can git checkout and run your tests from scratch.
</li><li>Design diagram identifying current key entities and relationships in the app,
i.e., what will be the most important models and how will they be related.
A UML class diagram is one way to do this, but any understandable informal method is acceptable.
Update this diagram on each iteration.
</li><li>Implement the user stories selected for the iteration and make sure that all test cases can be run automatically
and that the test cases pass.
</li><li><strong>Deploy to Heroku</strong>, verify that the user stories are working, and demo for the customer and obtain customer feedback.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Submit</strong> the following (only one copy for each team), with all elements in a single <strong>pdf</strong> file:</p>
<ol><li> Customer meeting date to demo this iteration.
</li><li>User stories implemented in this iteration.
</li><li> Design diagram for this iteration.
</li><li>Any additional documentation related to the user stories, e.g. changes to lo-fi UIs.
</li><li>If you were not able to implement all the stories that you initially chose for this iteration, please list which ones and why not.
</li><li>If you have changed any of your stories, please write a short description of the changes made and the reason behind the changes.
</li><li>If you are working on a legacy project, please list any user stories that were rewritten and code refactored.
</li><li>Evaluations of your code and tests, such as SimpleCov and CodeClimate
</li><li>Links to your Pivotal Tracker, Github repo, and Heroku deployment. Make sure these are up-to-date.
</li></ol>

<p>Please tag your git repository revision with <strong>Iteration1</strong>, <strong>Iteration2</strong>, etc.
Here are some example commands for how to tag revisions:</p>
<ul><li> To tag the current revision: <code>git tag -a Iteration1</code>
</li><li> <strong>Warning</strong>: You must explicitly push your tags with the command <code>git push --tags</code>. Before you submit, please make sure that when we clone, we can see the tag.
 </li></ul>
<p>
Grading will be based on the quality of user stories, comprehensiveness, and success of your test cases.
We might also create our own test cases. Make sure that we can git checkout and run your tests from scratch.
