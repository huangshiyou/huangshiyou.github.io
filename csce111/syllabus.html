<h1>Prerequisites
</h1>
<p>
CSCE 315 or approval of instructor. You should be experienced in object-oriented software development.</p>

<div id="course-format" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Format
</h1>
<p>
The class meets twice a week for lectures. Classroom material is enhanced with assigned readings.
A major component of the course is teamwork on a group project. Individual work includes reading summaries, quizzes, programming assignments, and a final exam.

<div id="grading" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading
</h1>
<p>The scores you receive on the various graded tasks in the class will be weighted 
as follows:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped">
<tr><td>10%</td><td>
    Class Participation (Team)
</td></tr>
<tr><td>30%</td><td>Assignments</td></tr>
<tr><td>20%</td><td>Quizes(4)</td></tr>
<tr><td>20%</td><td>Project</td></tr>
<tr><td>20%</td><td>Final exam</td></tr>
<tr id="totalsRow"><td>100%</td><td>Your total score for the class</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Grades are assigned based on the standard curve: 90-100 A, 80-89 B, 70-79 C, 60-69 D, below 60 F. If necessary a curve will be used.</p>
<p><strong>Late policy</strong>: Late submission beyond the deadline will not receive full credit earned in general, unless a University sanctioned excuse is provided ahead of time. In general, late submission will be penalized with a loss of 25% of
the total points earned per day late. Partial credit will be given based on the work submitted. For teamwork, late submissions will affect all team members. After grades distributed/returned, there is one week time limit to notify the instructor of any questions or concerns in the grading.</p>
 <p><strong>Make-up policy</strong>: Make-ups for quizzes, assignments and exams will be given only under circumstances beyond
student’s control (a university sanctioned excuse). Prior arrangements with the instructor must be made
when feasible and official verification of circumstances necessitating the absence will be required.</p>

<h1>Policies</h1>
<p><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</strong>:
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.
Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.
If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White Creek complex on west campus, or call 979-845-1637.

<p><strong>Academic Misconduct</strong>:
Collaboration on coursework is forbidden except where specifically specified as "Team" activities.
In general, one team may not collaborate with another team on "Team" activities.
As commonly defined, plagiarism consists of passing off as one's own the ideas, work, writings, etc.,
that below to another. In accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you copy the work of another person
and turn it in as your own, even if you have the permission of the person.
Plagiarism is one of the worst academic sins, for the plagiarist destroys the trust among colleagues
without which research cannot be safely communicated. Students violating this policy will be subject
to procedures described in Section 20 (Academic Misconduct) of the current edition of the Texas A&M University Student Rules (<a
href="http://student-rules.tamu.edu/">http://student-rules.tamu.edu</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity Statement</strong>:
"An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do." Upon accepting admission to Texas A&M University,
a student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for
learning and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor System. Students will be required to state
their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic work.
Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the Texas A&M University
community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor System. For additional information,
please visit <a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
On all course work, assignments, and examinations at Texas A&M University,
the following Honor Pledge shall be preprinted and signed by the student:
"<strong>On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.</strong>"</p>
<p><strong>Copyrights</strong>:

This includes Web site content, class slides, text, papers, syllabi, projects, homework, handouts, textbook, etc.  Because these materials are copyrighted, it is illegal for you to copy the handouts, unless expressly granted permission.
