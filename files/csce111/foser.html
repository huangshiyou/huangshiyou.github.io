  <p>Software is the invisible writing that whispers the stories of possibilities to our hardware. We are the story makers. We are the story tellers.</p>
  </h3>
  </li>
	    <li>
  <h3>
    <p>Developing software is like producing a film. You come together in a small group, work frantically for a while and if you are successful you may have a sequel. If you are really successful then you have a franchise.</p>
    </h3>

					 	 <li><h3>
	<p> Developing software is like raising a child, specially for young children or you code, you can encounter bad smell.</p>

  </li>
	 <li><h3>
	     Software development is just like making love, with lots of mechanics involved but ultimately its art.

	 <li><h3>
	 Computing has changed everything but really we have just begun.
	    </h3>
  </li>	  

	    <li><h3>
	 No matter what future you might imagine, it will rely on software-intensive systems not yet built.
	    </h3>
  </li>
  	    <li><h3>
  Hardware is the stuff that it doesn't work when you kick. Software is the stuff that doesn't work when you yell at.
  </h3>
  </li>

    <h3>
  Old software never dies, you have to kill it.
  </h3>
  </li>

      <li><h3>
  Software engineering is not just about the technology. It's also about the engineering of the human that's involved.
  </h3>
  </li>
        <li><h3>
  We are the ones who are changing civilization line by line.

	 The fundamental premise of science is that the cosmos is understandable; the fundamental premise of our domain is that the cosmos is computable.

<h3>Of all the engineering principles which are abstraction, separation of concerns, information hiding and simplicity, simplicity is the hardest.</h3>

	 Few years ago when Amazon was relatively small Jeff Bezos sent a message to his engineers that everything shal be a service. Engineers initially disagreed but Jeff insisted on it and the engineers began to componentize the codebase of Amazon which was around a couple of million lines of code thus everything became a service. Those were the early days of the creation of web service.

	 She (Margaret Hamilton)'s the person largely responsible for writing the software for the Apollo 11 guidance computer. And, if you may remember, when Armstrong was landing, there was a computer alarm that went off, the computer was actually getting too much data, it was in the wrong kind of mode. He properly shut it off. And if she had not programmed it such to fail safely, they probably would have aborted the mission. So, her code, which was a real focus on safety and security and correctness, is pretty much what saved that landing.‚Äù
