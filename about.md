I am currently working as a senior performance engineer at Arm Ltd., Austin, US.
My job responsibilities include automating the process of performance analysis over various workloads;
and ananlyzing the performance bottlenecks of openjdk on arm and x86 CPUs.
Before that,
I obtained my Degree of Ph.D. at 
<a href="http://www.cs.tamu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, December. 2019. 
During my PhD study,
I did research on stateless model checking, relaxed memory models, concurrency debugging, 
symbolic execution and testing. 
I got my Degree of B.S from Department of Computer Science, 
<a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>, June 2015.
